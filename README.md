### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of EspÃ­rito Santo and you can reach me on my [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/guilhermegoncalvess)

I'm experienced FullStack Developer with expertise in NodeJs, Javascript/Typescript, and Python. I have worked on scenarios involving the migration of legacy systems to microservices architecture and front-end development using React and Nextjs.

I have a strong focus on code quality, implementing best practices such as code review, unit testing, and quality metrics analysis with SonarQube. I also have knowledge of relational and non-relational databases and data storage in memory (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and REDIS).

In addition, I have knowledge and interest in creating cloud-native applications using solutions offered by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) such as GKE, Google Cloud Storage, and PubSub.
